    "2. **Embeddings** → Convert text to vectors (Day 1)\n",

    "# Summary: Your Complete RAG Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **The RAG Pipeline**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Data → Embeddings → Vector Store → Retrieval → LLM → Answer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Production Code Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions:**\n",
    "- ✅ Reusable code blocks\n",
    "- ✅ Easy to test\n",
    "- ✅ Clear inputs/outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes:**\n",
    "- ✅ Manage state (knowledge base, embeddings)\n",
    "- ✅ Clean API (`rag.query()`)\n",
    "- ✅ Extensible (inheritance for multi-provider)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type Hints & Docstrings:**\n",
    "- ✅ Self-documenting code\n",
    "- ✅ Catches errors early\n",
    "- ✅ Better IDE support\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **From Simple to Production**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Approach | Best For | Limitations |\n",
    "|----------|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Functions** | Learning, prototypes | Passing data repeatedly |\n",
    "| **SimpleRAG Class** | Small projects | In-memory only |\n",
    "| **MultiProviderRAG** | Flexibility | Still in-memory |\n",
    "| **ProductionRAG** | Real applications | Requires vector DB |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant info using meaning, not keywords\n",
    "- **Context Window**: How much text the LLM can process\n",
    "- **Top-K Retrieval**: Get K most relevant documents\n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity**: Measure how similar two vectors are (0-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Practice with your own data**\n",
    "   - PDFs, documentation, notes\n",
    "   - Use `PyPDF2` or `langchain` loaders\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ✅ **Advanced RAG Techniques**\n",
    "   - Chunking strategies\n",
    "   - Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)\n",
    "   - Re-ranking retrieved documents\n",
    "   - Parent-child chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ✅ **Production Enhancements**\n",
    "   - Error handling\n",
    "   - Logging and monitoring\n",
    "   - Caching for repeated queries\n",
    "   - Rate limiting\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ✅ **Learn Advanced Tools**\n",
    "   - LangChain (RAG framework)\n",
    "   - LlamaIndex (data framework)\n",
    "   - Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)\n",
